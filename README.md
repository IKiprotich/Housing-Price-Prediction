California Housing Price Prediction Model üè†

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts median housing prices for California districts using the California Housing Dataset. The model combines both numerical and textual data, such as property descriptions, to make predictions.

Overview

This project demonstrates:
	1.	How to preprocess mixed data types (numerical and textual).
	2.	Training a regression model using both structured data (like median income, house age) and unstructured data (like property descriptions).
	3.	Saving and reloading trained models for future predictions.

The pipeline uses Linear Regression as the base model, with preprocessing steps like:
	‚Ä¢	Standardizing numerical features.
	‚Ä¢	Vectorizing text descriptions.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Predicts housing prices based on features like:
	‚Ä¢	Median Income (MedInc)
	‚Ä¢	Average Rooms (AveRooms)
	‚Ä¢	Property Descriptions (Description)
	‚Ä¢	Combines numerical and textual data using preprocessing pipelines.
	‚Ä¢	Saves trained models for reuse with Joblib.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and the following libraries installed:
	‚Ä¢	numpy
	‚Ä¢	pandas
	‚Ä¢	scikit-learn
	‚Ä¢	joblib
	‚Ä¢	matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Installation
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-price-prediction.git
cd california-housing-price-prediction


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the script:

python housing_price_model.py

Usage

Training the Model

The script trains a model on the California Housing Dataset. To retrain:
	1.	Modify the descriptions or feature preprocessing steps in the code.
	2.	Run the script to create a new model.

Predicting Prices for New Data
	1.	Add your property details (numerical and text) in the new_house dictionary.
	2.	Run the script to predict the price.

Example input:

new_house = pd.DataFrame({
    'MedInc': [3.0],
    'HouseAge': [20.0],
    'AveRooms': [5.0],
    'AveBedrms': [2.0],
    'Population': [1000.0],
    'AveOccup': [3.0],
    'Latitude': [37.5],
    'Longitude': [-122.5],
    'Description': ["Eco-friendly home with solar panels and green features"]
})

How It Works
	1.	Dataset: Uses the California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn.
	2.	Preprocessing:
	‚Ä¢	Scales numerical data using StandardScaler.
	‚Ä¢	Converts text descriptions into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
	3.	Model Training: Trains a LinearRegression model on the processed features.
	4.	Evaluation: Computes metrics like Mean Squared Error to assess model performance.
	5.	Prediction: Predicts prices for new houses based on input features.

Model Performance

Current Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Add your model‚Äôs MSE here after testing]
	‚Ä¢	R¬≤ Score: [Add your R¬≤ score here]

Use the evaluation metrics to determine how well the model performs on test data.

Fine-Tuning

To improve the model:
	1.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal model parameters.
	2.	Feature Engineering: Add new features (e.g., AveRoomsPerHousehold).
	3.	Change Model: Try other models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
